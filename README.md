# MATLAB Image Processing
### University Course

Application build in `MATLAB` for the purposes of image processing demonstration. The project's goal is to analyze the portraits of people
belonging to different racial groups and to predict the according group label. 
Preprocessing image manipulations include color adjustment and binarization. 

A feedforward neural network is trained for the purpose of classification. The dataset consists of the portraits of 40 
people belonging to the total of 4 different races.

## Usage

FIle `app1.mlapp` can be opened and run in a MATLAB environment which produces a GUI with "Browse" and "Determine" options.
